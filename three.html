    <!-- <span> Tag
The <span> tag in HTML is an inline container used to group and style parts of a text or document. It does not inherently carry any meaning or visual formatting but is often used with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to apply specific styles or functionality to a part of the content within a larger block of text.
